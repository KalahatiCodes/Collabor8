# Collabor8
## Collabor8 Inception (A very optional read background story)
One late night I was out at a popular local venue space to support one of my good friend's performances. I'm not much of a late night hypeman type so I often find myself having one-one and small group conversations. While waiting for the performance to begin I sat in the outdoor patio are with our friend, Sevi, who began telling me about a new community-oriented venture: 

A nation wide collective of low income animators collaborating on several comics and animations to create something unique (and probably a little crazy).
Sevi stated that the idea is to have hundreds working on a project at a time. BUT...
Being low-income there being restraints surrounding how to collaborate using the tools they currently use. Issues they stated with those tools were the ability to have a file open on more than two devices at once. To me, the idea of having hundreds of un-established animators all in various parts of the country working on one project file sounded chaotic.

And then it hit me! I sipped my beer and said "Sevi, what you need is a github for animators but I have no idea how to do that". And then I decided to f*ck around and find out.  

So, today I present to you the most recent version of Collabor8.

## Collabor8 Imagined
Collabor8, in all of it's infancy, is an animator repository application designed for large groups of animators working collaboratively on projects. Ideally a GitHub for Procreate! Collabor8 is a free tool designed for low income creators looking to cooperatively create animation art. This tool allows lower income and independent individual/group animators to track, organize, edit, and update collective animation works in a streamlined and trackable fashion.

Here's where you can go to town on how you actually built this thing. Write as much as you can here, it's totally fine if it's not too much just make sure you write *something*. If you don't have too much experience on your resume working on the front end that's totally fine. This is where you can really show off your passion and make up for that ten fold. 

## Features & Optimizations

#### Functionality

<!-- You don't have to include this section but interviewers *love* that you can not only deliver a final product that looks great but also functions efficiently. Did you write something then refactor it later and the result was 5x faster than the original implementation? Did you cache your assets? Things that you write in this section are **GREAT** to bring up in interviews and you can use this section as reference when studying for technical interviews! -->

## Lessons Learned:

No matter what your experience level, being an engineer means continuously learning. Every time you build something you always have those *whoa this is awesome* or *fuck yeah I did it!* moments. This is where you should share those moments! Recruiters and interviewers love to see that you're self-aware and passionate about growing.
